# Embedded Comparo: Small DSP Systems Side-by-Side

## NIME 2025 | June 24â€“27, Canberra, Australia

Welcome to the official repository accompanying our publication: **"Embedded Comparo: Small DSP Systems Side-by-Side"** presented at NIME 2025. This repository provides comprehensive documentation and resources for deploying real-time audio patches using **Pure Data (Pd)** across four embedded platforms: **Bela**, **Daisy**, **OWL**, and **Raspberry Pi**.

## Introduction

Embedded systems have become vital for digital musical instrument design and interactive audio projects. However, deploying audio DSP patches across various hardware platforms often involves complex and inconsistent workflows. This project addresses this challenge by providing comparative insights and unified Pure Data deployment workflows across four widely-used platforms.

Our aim is to simplify the process for musicians, researchers, educators, and developers, facilitating broader adoption and easier collaboration.

## Repository Structure

Each platform folder contains:

* A `template.pd` file with hardware-specific configurations
* Pure Data patches:

  * `fm.pd`: Simple FM synthesis
  * `granular.pd`: Granular synthesis
  * `cloud_generator.pd`: Real-time granular generator

---

## Getting Started

Detailed deployment instructions for each platform can be found in the respective folders or in the [deployment/](./deployment/) directory.

To test a patch:

1. Begin with the `template.pd` and ensure hardware input/output is correctly mapped.
2. Load your chosen main patch (e.g., `fm.pd`) into your platform's IDE.
3. Follow specific build or compilation steps detailed for Bela, Daisy, and OWL.
4. Raspberry Pi users can run patches natively or via Patchbox OS.
