# Raspberry Pi Platform (Organelle)

The Organelle by Critter & Guitari runs on a Raspberry Pi 3 and executes Pd patches natively on a Linux OS.

Users can upload patches via Wi-Fi or USB. The Organelle is designed to operate both standalone and with external peripherals (monitor, keyboard, mouse).

Pd patches can be loaded through a web interface or manually through the file system.
