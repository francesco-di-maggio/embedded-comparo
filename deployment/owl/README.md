# OWL Platform

The OWL (OpenWareLab) platform is a family of programmable audio devices developed by Rebel Technology.

It supports Pd via a **cloud-based Web IDE** that uses the [Heavy Compiler](https://github.com/enzienaudio/heavy) to convert Pd patches into C++.

You can manage and deploy patches through your browser by connecting the device via USB-MIDI.
