# Bela Platform

Bela is an embedded platform for ultra-low latency audio and sensor processing, ideal for real-time sound applications.

It supports Pure Data (Pd) deployment through two modes:
- **libpd mode**: Runs Pd patches using the built-in browser-based IDE.
- **Heavy mode**: Compiles Pd patches into optimized C++ using the Heavy Compiler (hvcc).

Bela provides a local web server accessible at [http://bela.local](http://bela.local), where users can upload, edit, and run projects.
